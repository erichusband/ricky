# v8.0.0 Migration guide

This guide assumes you have an existing app running on `sku v7`. If you are still on a version of sku prior to v7, please checkout the [v7 Migration guide](./migration-guides/v7.0.0) as well.

> If you have any issues or concerns updating to sku v8, please post in the #sku-support slack channel.

**Obligatory warning to check everything still works**

We try to validate sku works across a big variety of scenarios before releasing. However, as with all major sku releases, please validate that your app continues to work as expected in a real environment as well as locally.

## Peer dependencies

`React` is now a `peerDependency` of sku. Ensure your version of React falls within the required range.

> At the time of release, sku requires `React v16.3.0` or above.

## Dynamic imports

If you are utilizing dynamic imports in your app, you may want to consider migrating them to be [loadable-components](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/). Dynamic imports should continue to work as before but you may receive benefits by utilizing `loadable`.

See [Code splitting](./docs/code-splitting) for more info on how to do this.

## SkuProvider

The `SkuProvider` is a React component that needs to be rendered at the very top level of the app. This only needs to be done as part of the [render](./docs/building-the-app#render) or [server](./docs/building-the-app#server) entry (depending on the app type), it is **not** required for the [client](./docs/building-the-app#client) entry.

There are further updates to the SSR render API. [See here](#rendercallback).

### Render entry example

```diff
import React from 'react';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import App from './App';

export default {
-  renderApp: ({ environment, site, route }) =>
+  renderApp: ({ SkuProvider, environment, site, route }) =>
    renderToString(
+      <SkuProvider>
        <App environment={environment} site={site} route={route} />
+      </SkuProvider>
    ),

  renderDocument: ({ app, bodyTags, headTags }) => `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>My Awesome Project</title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        ${headTags}
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="app">${app}</div>
        ${bodyTags}
      </body>
    </html>
  `
};
```

## Client entry

The client entry should now export a function rather than hydrating the app immediately.

```diff
import React from 'react';
import { hydrate } from 'react-dom';
import App from './App/App';

+export default () => {
  hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
+};
```

> Statically rendered apps should checkout the new [provideClientContext](../docs/static-rendering.md#provideclientcontext) feature, for passing config and other state from render to the client.

## Storybook

Any imports from `sku/storybook` must be changed to `sku/@storybook/react`:

```diff
-import { storiesOf } from 'sku/storybook';
+import { storiesOf } from 'sku/@storybook/react';
```

## **Static render apps**

### Route specific entries

Route specific entries have been removed in favour of `loadable-components`.

```diff
module.exports = {
  routes: [
    {
      route: '/',
      name: 'home',
-     entry: './src/home'
    }
  ]
};
```

If you were utilizing the old route entry behaviour, read through [Code splitting](./docs/code-splitting) and checkout the [code splitting by route example](./docs/code-splitting#code-splitting-by-route). If you still have any concerns please contact #sku-support for help.

### devTransformOutputPath

The `devTransformOutputPath` option in sku config has been removed. If you were using it before please contact the #sku-support channel.

## **SSR apps**

### renderCallback

The `renderCallback` API has changed due to the new way sku renders your script/style tags. `bodyTags` and `headTags` are now the functions `getBodyTags` and `getHeadTags` respectively. Also, they are now passed in per request with the `SkuProvider`, rather than at startup time.

_**WARNING:** `getBodyTags` and `getHeadTags` must be called **after** `renderToString`!_

```diff
-export default ({ headTags, bodyTags }) => ({
+export default () => ({
-  renderCallback: (req, res) => {
+  renderCallback: ({ SkuProvider, getBodyTags, getHeadTags }, req, res) => {
    const app = renderToString(
+      <SkuProvider>
        <App />
+      </SkuProvider>
    );
    res.send(
-     template({ headTags, bodyTags, app })
+     template({ headTags: getHeadTags(), bodyTags: getBodyTags(), app })
    );
  }
});

```
